# Common Description Format for C++ Libraries and Packages

By a bunch of folks

# Summary

The incorporation of C++ Modules into C++20 has increased the pressure for C++ package providers and consumers to find a shared communication mechanism to describe module-based C++ libraries and packages.  The community has skimped by with traditional header-file based libraries and packages, those conventional methods are no longer sufficient for modules.  Failure to act now can lead to further fragmentation of the C++ community along a variety or more-or-less competing or incompatible tools boundaries.  This paper requests the creation of a focused subgroup of SG15 to define, ideally with some reference implementation, a format specification for describing C++ libraries and packages.  The output of the subgroup is expected to be the basis of a Technical Report for further consideration by WG21 and its subgroups.  Consequently, we request that it be hosted alongside other WG21 working groups' projects.
